# BI Sales

The scope of the project is to simulate a BI project for an ERP system and improve the visualization side of Sales Dashboard.

For this project, I used data from the AdventureWorks2019 database and Power BI for the visualization part.
The Dashboard is separated into 8 pages.

The first page is a navigation menu to help users go easier to the page they want.

The second page is for Instructions where there are some similar details as here, in order to help users understand what the report is all about, even if they don't have access to GitHub.

The third page (Revenue current month) shows a big-picture view of the current month from different perspectives. Here we can see different types of KPIs and sales results from different perspectives (top items, top/bottom salespeople, top stores, and customers)

The “Sales analysis” page is used to compare data from the current year with data from the last year (or any number of past years) from the perspective of revenue in general, revenue by stores, and salespeople.

The next three pages (Salespeople, Products, and Customers) are used to present different KPIs for sales from these three points of view.

The last page, the Settings page, is used to get input from the user regarding different targets or commissions in order to create dynamics reports.

All of this can be seen in the "BI Sales.pbix" file.
